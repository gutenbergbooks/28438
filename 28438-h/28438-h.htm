to robotics with this story of Rankin, who prided himself on knowing
how to handle robots, but did not realize that the robots of the Clearchan

<p class="pr1"><big><b>They had come to pass judgement on him. He had violated
their law&mdash;wilfully, ignorantly, and very deliberately.</b></big></p></div>

<p>"<span class="dcap">Our</span> people will be arriving
to visit us today," the robot
said.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Rod
Rankin. He jumped, wiry and
quick, out of the chair on his
verandah and stared at a cloud
of dust in the distance.</p>

<p>"Our people&mdash;" the ten-foot,
cylinder-bodied robot grated,
when Rod Rankin interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"I don't care about your
fool people," said Rankin. He
squinted at the cloud of dust
getting bigger and closer beyond
the wall of <i>kesh</i> trees
that surrounded the rolling
acres of his plantation. "That
damned new neighbor of mine
is coming over here again."</p>

<p>He gestured widely, taking
in the dozens of robots with
their shiny, cylindrical bodies
and pipestem arms and legs
laboring in his fields. "Get all
your people together and go
hide in the wood, fast."</p>

<p>"It is not right," said the
robot. "We were made to serve
all."</p>

<p>"Well, there are only a hundred
of you, and I'm not sharing
you with anybody," said
Rankin.</p>

<p>"It is not right," the robot
repeated.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about
what's right," said Rankin.
"You're built to follow orders,
nothing else. I know a thing
or two about how you robots
work. You've got one law, to
follow orders, and until that
neighbor of mine sees you to
give you orders, you work for
me. Now get into those woods
and hide till he goes away."</p>

<p>"We will go to greet those
who visit us today," said the
robot.</p>

<p>"Alright, alright, scram,"
said Rankin.</p>

<p>The robots in the fields and
the one whom Rankin had
been talking to formed a column
and marched off into the
trackless forests behind his
plantation.</p>

<p>A battered old ground-car
drove up a few minutes later.
A tall, broad-shouldered man
with a deep tan got out and
walked up the path to Rankin's
verandah.</p>

<p>"Hi, Barrows," said Rankin.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Barrows. "See
your crop's coming along pretty
well. Can't figure how you
do it. You've got acres and
acres to tend, far's I can see,
and I'm having a hell of a
time with one little piece of
ground. I swear you must
know something about this
planet that I don't know."</p>

<p>"Just scientific farming,"
said Rankin carelessly. "Look,
you come over here for something,
or just to gab? I got
a lot of work to do."</p>

<p>Barrows looked weary and
worried. "Them brown beetles
is at my crop again," he said.
"Thought you might know
some way of getting rid of
them."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Rankin. "Pick
them off, one by one. That's
how I get rid of them."</p>

<p>"Why, man," said Barrows,
"you can't walk all over these
miles and miles of farm and
pick off every one of them
beetles. You must know another
way."</p>

<p>Rankin drew himself up and
stared at Barrows. "I'm telling
you all I feel like telling
you. You going to stand here
and jaw all day? Seems to me
like you got work to do."</p>

<p>"Rankin," said Barrows, "I
know you were a crook back
in the Terran Empire, and
that you came out beyond the
border to escape the law.
Seems to me, though, that
even a crook, any man, would
be willing to help his only
neighbor out on a lone planet
like this. You might need help
yourself, sometime."</p>

<p>"You keep your thoughts
about my past to yourself,"
said Rankin. "Remember, I
keep a gun. And you've got a
wife and a whole bunch of
kids on that farm of yours.
Be smart and let me alone."</p>

<p>"I'm going," said Barrows.
He walked off the verandah
and turned and spat carefully
into the dusty path. He
climbed into his ground-car
and drove off.</p>

<p>Rankin, angry, watched him
go. Then he heard a humming
noise from another direction.</p>

<p>He turned. A huge, white
globe was descending across
the sky. A space ship, thought
Rankin, startled.</p>

<p>Police? This planet was
outside the jurisdiction of the
Terran Empire. When he'd
cracked that safe and made off
with a hundred thousand credits,
he'd headed here, because
the planet was part of something
called the Clearchan
Confederacy. No extradition
treaties or anything. Perfectly
safe, if the planet was safe.</p>

<p>And the planet was more
than safe. There had been a
hundred robots waiting when
he landed. Where they came
from he didn't know, but Rankin
prided himself on knowing
how to handle robots. He'd
appropriated their services
and started his farm. At the
rate he was going, he'd be a
plantation owner before long.</p>

<p>That must be where the ship
was from. The robot said
they'd expected visitors. Must
be the Clearchan Confederacy
visiting this robot outpost.
Was that good or bad?</p>

<p>From everything he'd read,
and from what the robots had
told him, they were probably
more robots. That was good,
because he knew how to handle
robots.</p>

<p>The white globe disappeared
into the jungle of <i>kesh</i>
trees. Rankin waited.</p>

<p>A half hour later the column
of his robot laborers
marched out of the forest.
There were three more robots,
painted grey, at the head. The
new ones from the ship,
thought Rankin. Well, he'd
better establish who was boss
right from the start.</p>

<p>"Stop right there!" he
shouted.</p>

<p>The shiny robot laborers
halted. But the three grey
ones came on.</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted Rankin.</p>

<p>They didn't stop, and by the
time they reached the verandah,
he cursed himself for
having failed to get his gun.</p>

<p>Two of the huge grey robots
laid gentle hands on his
arms. Gentle hands, but hands
of superstrong metal.</p>

<p>The third said, "We have
come to pass judgement on
you. You have violated our
law."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said
Rankin. "The only law robots
have is to obey orders."</p>

<p>"It is true that the robots
of your Terran Empire and
these simple workers here
must obey orders. But they
are subject to a higher law,
and you have forced them to
break it. That is your crime."</p>

<p>"What crime?" said Rankin.</p>

<p>"We of the Clearchan Confederacy
are a race of robots.
Our makers implanted one
law in us, and then passed on.
We have carried our law to
all the planets we have colonized.
In obeying your orders,
these workers were simply
following that one law. You
must be taken to our capital,
and there be imprisoned and
treated for your crime."</p>

<p>"What law? What crime?"</p>

<p>"Our law," said the giant
robot, "is, <i>Help thy neighbor</i>."</p>
